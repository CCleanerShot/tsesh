# tsesh

I have really been enjoying just using a tmux sessionizer but I constantly find
it falls short on some things. The key thing that I think it is missing is
bookmarks! I want to be able to bookmark websites or other directories not
included on the regular search without expanding the search depth.

What I am currently thinking of is a mix between harpoon and my current tmux
sessionizer.

For now I want to recreate my current tmux-sessionizer bash script, it should
search for directories on a hard coded list of paths, serve them as a list and
then select a directory item and start a tmux session at that path.

Simple start then I will see how I can add what I want it to do little by
little.
